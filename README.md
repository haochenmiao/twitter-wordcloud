The topic of this research is tweets related to the keywords "God", "judgmental", "hypocritical", "compassionate", "Christian", "Jesus Christ", "love", and "hate". These keywords were chosen because they relate to religious and moral beliefs and attitudes and can give insight into the way these concepts are perceived and discussed on social media. The parameters used for the search were the search term, location, language, and date range. The search term was a combination of keywords related to the topic, separated by the OR operator to retrieve tweets containing any of the keywords. The location was set to Seattle, Brisbane and Washington DC, three different geographical areas to compare the tweets from different locations. The language was set to "en" to retrieve tweets in English. The date range was set to "2023-1-21" to retrieve tweets since that date.

The reason for making this comparison was to understand how the concepts of God, judgment, hypocrisy, compassion, Christianity, Jesus Christ, love, and hate are discussed on social media in different geographical areas. By analyzing the results, it is possible to identify patterns and trends in how these concepts are perceived and discussed in different cultural contexts and how they relate to each other in these different contexts.

By comparing the word clouds from Seattle, Washington DC, and Brisbane, it is possible to observe the difference in the frequency of the words used. For example, certain words might be used more frequently in one location than the other, indicating that those concepts are more prevalent or more discussed in that specific location. Additionally, the words that are used in conjunction with each other might also differ between locations, indicating how the concepts are related and perceived differently in different locations.
The patterns observed in the word clouds might be the result of the specific geographical area and the time frame chosen for the search. For example, certain religious or political events or movements in the area might influence the way the keywords are discussed. Additionally, the patterns might also be influenced by the specific keywords chosen and how they relate to each other. For example, the word "Lord" might be used more frequently in Washington DC, which is known for its strong religious history and presence, compared to Brisbane, which might not have as strong of a religious presence.

We can also observe that there are some similarities and some differences in the way the concepts are discussed on social media in different geographical areas.
In terms of similarities, all three locations have a high frequency of the words "people" and "believe". This suggests that these concepts are commonly discussed across all three locations, regardless of the cultural or social context. Additionally, all three locations also have a high frequency of words such as "people" and "out", which further confirms that these concepts are commonly discussed across all three locations.
In terms of differences, the word cloud from Seattle has a higher frequency of the words "fuck" and "oh" compared to the word clouds from DC and Brisbane. This suggests that these concepts may be more prevalent or more discussed in Seattle, compared to the other two locations. Additionally, the word cloud from Washington DC has a higher frequency of the word "one" compared to the word clouds from Seattle and Brisbane, which may indicate that this concept is more prevalent or more discussed in Washington DC.
The reason why these locations represent different context is that they are in different countries and have different cultural, social and political contexts. Seattle and Washington DC are both located in the United States and share similar cultural and political contexts, while Brisbane is located in Australia and has a different cultural, social and political context. Therefore, the way the concepts are discussed on social media in these locations may be influenced by the specific context of each location.

The possible reasons for the patterns observed might be due to the different cultural, social and political factors that influence the way these concepts are perceived and discussed in different geographical areas. Additionally, the difference in data might also be due to the population and social media usage in the specific areas.

To improve the research in the future, the sample size could be increased to get a more comprehensive view. Additionally, more advanced text analysis techniques such as sentiment analysis or topic modeling could be used to gain deeper insights into the data. Furthermore, searching for tweets from multiple locations across different countries would provide a broader perspective.

One thing that stands out to me from the data is that while the word "people" is present in all three locations, the word "hypocritical" is not as prevalent in the word clouds from Seattle and Washington DC as I had expected. I had anticipated that the word "hypocritical" would be more prevalent in the data, especially in light of the current political climate and the rise of divisive rhetoric. However, the data suggests that the concepts of "people" and "Lord" are more commonly discussed on social media than "hypocritical" in these locations. This could indicate that the conversation on social media in these locations is more focused on positive and spiritual uplifting concepts, rather than negative or divisive concepts. This is something that I did not expect before conducting the exercise and it is interesting to see this pattern in the data. Additionally, the small sample size from Brisbane may not accurately represent the way the concepts are discussed on social media in that area.

In conclusion, this research provided a comparison of how the concepts of God, judgment, hypocrisy, compassion, Christianity, Jesus Christ, love, and hate are discussed on social media in Washington DC and Brisbane and Seattle. The comparison showed that there were similarities and differences in the way these concepts are perceived and discussed in different geographical areas. Additionally, the research also highlighted the impact of cultural, social and political factors on how these concepts are perceived and discussed in different areas.
