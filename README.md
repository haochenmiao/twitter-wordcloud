The topic of this research is tweets related to the keywords "God", "judgmental", "hypocritical", "compassionate", "Christian", "Jesus Christ", "love", and "hate". These keywords were chosen because they relate to religious and moral beliefs and attitudes and can give insight into the way these concepts are perceived and discussed on social media. The parameters used for the search were the search term, location, language, and date range. The search term was a combination of keywords related to the topic, separated by the OR operator to retrieve tweets containing any of the keywords. The location was set to Washington DC and Brisbane, two different geographical areas to compare the tweets from different locations. The language was set to "en" to retrieve tweets in English. The date range was set to "2023-1-18" to retrieve tweets since that date.

The reason for making this comparison was to understand how the concepts of God, judgment, hypocrisy, compassion, Christianity, Jesus Christ, love, and hate are discussed on social media in different geographical areas. By analyzing the results, it is possible to identify patterns and trends in how these concepts are perceived and discussed in different cultural contexts and how they relate to each other in these different contexts.

When comparing the word clouds from Washington DC and Brisbane, it was observed that there was a significant difference in the amount of data retrieved. Washington DC had a huge amount of data while Brisbane had very few data. This difference in data might have been due to the location and the population of the specific area. Due to the larger population and more active social media usage in Washington DC, more tweets were retrieved. Additionally, Washington DC being the capital city of the United States might have more events and movements that are related to the keywords used in the search.

The word clouds from Washington DC and Brisbane showed some similarities and differences. Words like "God", "love", and "Jesus" were frequently used in both word clouds. However, the word cloud from Washington DC had a higher frequency of words like "people", "time", "world", and "like" which might indicate that the tweets from Washington DC were more general and less specific in comparison to the word cloud from Brisbane. On the other hand, the word cloud from Brisbane had a higher frequency of words like "Australia" and "Brisbane" which might indicate that the tweets from Brisbane were more specific to the location and events happening in that area.

The possible reasons for the patterns observed might be due to the different cultural, social and political factors that influence the way these concepts are perceived and discussed in different geographical areas. Additionally, the difference in data might also be due to the population and social media usage in the specific areas.

To improve the research in the future, the sample size could be increased to get a more comprehensive view. Additionally, more advanced text analysis techniques such as sentiment analysis or topic modeling could be used to gain deeper insights into the data. Furthermore, searching for tweets from multiple locations across different countries would provide a broader perspective.

One thing that stood out to me from the data was the significant difference in the amount of data retrieved from Washington DC and Brisbane. I had expected the data to be more balanced between the two locations, but the difference in data was quite substantial. This might have been due to the population and social media usage in each location, and it highlights the importance of considering these factors when conducting research. Additionally, the word clouds from Washington DC and Brisbane showed some similarities and differences in the way the concepts were discussed which was also unexpected, but it helped to understand how the concepts are perceived and discussed differently in different locations.

In conclusion, this research provided a comparison of how the concepts of God, judgment, hypocrisy, compassion, Christianity, Jesus Christ, love, and hate are discussed on social media in Washington DC and Brisbane. The comparison showed that there were similarities and differences in the way these concepts are perceived and discussed in different geographical areas. Additionally, the research also highlighted the impact of cultural, social and political factors on how these concepts are perceived and discussed in different areas.
